Got it 👍 thanks for sharing the full project description. Let’s break this down so you clearly understand what the project is about, and then I’ll give you a step-by-step roadmap of what to learn before you dive in.

🔎 What this project consists of

This is a practical Web3 exercise where you’ll:

Create your own token (a cryptocurrency-like digital asset) on a blockchain.

The token must have “42” in its name.

It should follow a token standard (like ERC-20 for Ethereum or BEP-20 for BNB Chain).

Set up a project structure:

README.md → explain your design and choices.

code/ → smart contract code for your token.

deployment/ → scripts/tools you used to deploy it.

documentation/ → guides, whitepaper, explanation of how to use the token.

Deploy the token on a test blockchain (not real money!) and publish the contract details on an explorer (like Etherscan/BscScan).

Demonstrate it works by showing basic functions:

Minting (creating tokens).

Transferring between accounts.

Checking balances.

Ownership/security rules.

(Optional bonus) → Implement multisignature security for more advanced use.

⚠️ Important: You won’t use real money. You’ll use test networks (like Ethereum Sepolia or BNB testnet) and faucets to get free fake tokens.

🛣️ Roadmap – What to Learn Before Starting

Since you said you have no Web3/Blockchain background, let’s build the path step by step:

1. Blockchain Fundamentals

What is blockchain? (decentralized ledger, consensus, immutability).

Difference between Ethereum and BNB Chain (both use EVM – Ethereum Virtual Machine).

What are tokens? (fungible ERC-20 vs non-fungible ERC-721).

What is a wallet? (Metamask, private keys, addresses).
